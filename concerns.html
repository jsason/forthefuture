                <p><strong>1. Air Pollution</strong><br><br>Air pollution is caused by particles and gases that are released into the air. These toxins can come from various factors, but the majority are from factories and vehicle fumes. Air pollution takes
                    a huge number of years to reverse.<br>Ozone is a greenhouse gas that is a major cause of air pollution. When it’s high up in the atmosphere, ozone is a good thing since it blocks radiation from the Sun. It becomes a problem when it’s
                    low in our atmosphere. Ozone is created by the burning of fossil fuels, usually from factories and car exhausts. Ozone combined with natural particles in the air create smog.<br><br><br><strong>2. Water Pollution</strong><br><br>Water
                    is thought of as a basic human right, however, clean drinking water isn’t as common as people think. Many sources of drinking water are getting polluted by industrial waste and agricultural activities.When toxic substances enter water
                    bodies, it degrades the water quality, making it toxic to humans and the environment. For example, factories might dump their chemical waste into a nearby river thinking it won’t harm anyone, but that river could be a source of water
                    for nearby animals.&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>3. Global Warming</strong><br><br>Global warming is closely related to air pollution and could almost fall under the same category. It’s known as the quick increase in Earth’s average temperature
                    over the last century due to greenhouse gasses being released by burning fossil fuels. Just like air pollution, the main causes are factories and vehicle exhaust.&nbsp;<br>Global warming is a huge concern we need to address as soon
                    as possible. As temperatures increase, Earth’s weather patterns change and sea levels quickly rise, causing many species into extinction and a huge obstacle for people in developing countries to face.<br><br><br><strong>4. Deforestation</strong><br><br>Deforestation
                    is the mass clearing of forests around the world. Most people cut down trees for reasons such as starting a fire, building furniture and paper, and making space for crops. However, some companies will clear a whole forest just to make
                    space for creating new buildings and overall profit. These companies fail to understand the effects of deforestation on the environment and ecosystem.<br>Trees are a huge source of oxygen and as forests are cut down, less oxygen is
                    being released into the atmosphere. Along with this, forests are home to an enormous range of living things. Many animals lose their habitats or are killed during this process. Deforestation also is a big cause of animal extinction,
                    especially those that live in rainforests.<br><br><br><strong>5. Marine Pollution</strong><br><br>released into bodies of water, which effects the daily lives of all marine life. One way marine pollution occurs is with chemical contamination. 
                    This is can be fertilizer that farmers use being washed off into waterways, or even factories dumping their chemical waste into rivers which then flows into the ocean. The second way is all the trash being left by humans, especially plastic. 
                    This can be from littering, poor waste management, or debris being blown by the wind. Plastic waste is especially harmful since it take hundreds of years to decompose and marine life are prone to getting tangled in items such as plastic bags. 
                    Fishes might even think these items are food and end up suffocating. Many organizations schedule cleanups for beaches to prevent further pollution.</p>
