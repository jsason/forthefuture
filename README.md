An accessible guide to current environmental concerns and issues.

## Purpose
This was a solo contribution to SheHacks V, a hackathon supporting women in STEM. The website describes environmental concerns in everyday language, making it accessible to people of all education levels. Readers are provided with the basics of topics frequently seen in the media and are also directed to charities, projects they can do from home, and updates from Environment Journal on Twitter.

## Access
The website can be accessed [here.](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) 

Another way to test the website is by using the [live share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) extension on Visual Studio Code.

A video of the website from the reader's perspective is also uploaded for demonstration purposes.
